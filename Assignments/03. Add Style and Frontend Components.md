# Objective
In this assignment, you will enhance your Django project by integrating a frontend toolchain using **Bun**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **DaisyUI**. These tools will allow you to efficiently manage your projectâ€™s frontend assets while following modern web development practices.
- **Bun** is a fast, all-in-one JavaScript runtime that will handle package management and scripts for your project.
- **Tailwind CSS** is a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development.
- **DaisyUI** is a plugin for Tailwind that provides pre-styled UI components.
This assignment will guide you through **installing and configuring these tools**, ensuring that your Django project is set up for styling and frontend development.
# Assignment Description
You will install **Bun**, initialize a Bun project, and configure **Tailwind CSS** and **DaisyUI**. This setup will allow your Django project to process CSS efficiently using a modern frontend toolchain.
By the end of this assignment, you will have:
- **Bun installed and initialized** in your `dj4e` project.
- **Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI installed** and configured for styling.
- A **watch script** to automatically compile Tailwind CSS when making changes.
- A structured approach for managing frontend assets in Django.
This assignment will introduce you to **frontend build tools** and their role in modern web development.
# Assignment
## 1. Install Bun
Bun is an alternative to Node.js, optimized for speed. Instead of using npm or yarn, we will use **Bun** to manage frontend dependencies in our project.
1. Open a terminal and navigate to your `dj4e/` project directory.
2. Run the following command to install Bun:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   ```
   - If the installation is successful, restart your terminal or run:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc if using Zsh
     ```
   - Confirm Bun is installed by running:
     ```bash
     bun --version
     ```
## 2. Initialize a Bun Project
1. Inside the `dj4e/` directory, initialize a Bun project:
   ```bash
   bun init
   ```
2. This will generate a `package.json` file, which will track your frontend dependencies.
## 3. Install Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI
1. Open `package.json` and modify the `devDependencies` section as follows:
   ```json
   "devDependencies": {
     "autoprefixer": "^10.4.20",
     "daisyui": "^4.12.24",
     "postcss": "^8.5.3",
     "tailwindcss": "^3.4.17"
   }
   ```
2. Install these dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
## 4. Set Up the CSS Build Process
1. Add the following script inside `package.json` under `"scripts"`:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "watch:css": "tailwindcss build -i ./django/static/css/main.css -o ./django/static/css/output.css -w"
   }
   ```
2. Run the script to start watching for changes:
   ```bash
   bun run watch:css
   ```
## 5. Configure Tailwind to Work with Django Templates
1. Locate `tailwind.config.ts` and **replace** its content with:
   ```ts
   import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss';
   import daisyui from 'daisyui';

   export default {
     content: ["./django/templates/**/*.html", "./django/**/templates/**/*.html"],
     darkMode: "media",
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     daisyui: {
       themes: [
         "light",
         "dark",
       ]
     },
     plugins: [daisyui],
   } satisfies Config;
   ```
## 6. Configure Django to Recognize Static Files
1. Open `settings.py` and add:
   ```python
   STATICFILES_DIRS = [
       os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),
   ]
   ```
2. Inside `django/`, create:
   ```
   django/
   â”œâ”€â”€ static/
       â”œâ”€â”€ css/
           â”œâ”€â”€ main.css
   ```
3. Add the following content to `main.css`:
   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```
## 7. Implement a Base Template for Reusability
1. Create `home/templates/home/base.html`:
   ```django
   {% load static %}

   <html lang="en" data-theme="dark">
       <head>
           <meta charset="UTF-8">
           <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
           <title>{% block title %}<Your Name's> Homepage{% endblock %}</title>
           <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/output.css' %}">
       </head>
       <body>
           {% block content %}
           {% endblock %}
       </body>
   </html>
   ```
2. Modify `home/templates/home/main.html`:
   ```django
   {% extends "home/base.html" %}

   {% block content %}

   <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">*** Steve's Homepage ***</h1>
   <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
       <li class="text-2xl">
           <a href="/hello" class="text-primary">Test the session</a>
       </li>
   </ul>

   {% endblock %}
   ```
## 8. Apply Styling with DaisyUI & Tailwind
Now that Tailwind and DaisyUI are set up, it's time to **customize your homepage**.  
- Visit **DaisyUI's component library**:  
  ðŸ“Œ [DaisyUI Components](https://v4.daisyui.com/components/)  
- Use Tailwind and DaisyUI **to enhance your homepageâ€™s design**.  
- Play around with **layouts, buttons, cards, and other UI elements**.  
- Be creative! This is your opportunity to **experiment and apply styling as you see fit**.
## 9. Troubleshooting & Debugging
If you encounter any issues, try the following:
### Errors with Dependencies
- Delete `node_modules` and reinstall dependencies:
  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules bun.lockb
  bun install
  ```
### Tailwind Not Applying Styles?
- Ensure your **Tailwind build process is running**:
  ```bash
  bun run watch:css
  ```
- Confirm `output.css` is correctly linked in `base.html`.
### DaisyUI Not Working?
- Verify that DaisyUI is **correctly listed** in `tailwind.config.ts` under `plugins`.
- Try setting an explicit theme in the `<html>` tag.
