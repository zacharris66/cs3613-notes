# Objective
In this assignment, you will create a new Django project from scratch and build multiple applications within it. You will configure a homepage, set up URL routing, and implement Django’s session framework to track user interactions. This assignment emphasizes a **Do-It-Yourself (DIY)** approach, requiring you to apply your understanding of Django’s architecture, templates, and session management without step-by-step instructions. By the end of this assignment, you will have a functional web application that includes a main page and a session-based counter, reinforcing your ability to read, adapt, and implement Django concepts independently.

# Assignment Description
In this assignment, you will create a new Django project named **dj4e** and develop two applications within it: **home** and **hello**. The **home** application will serve as the main entry point of your website, displaying a homepage when users visit the root URL (`/`). The **hello** application will demonstrate session management by tracking user visits and resetting after a certain number of requests.

Unlike previous assignments, this task provides fewer explicit instructions, encouraging you to take a **Do-It-Yourself (DIY)** approach. You will be responsible for interpreting the requirements, referencing sample code, and adapting Django’s built-in functionality to meet the assignment objectives.

By the end of this assignment, you will have:

- A working Django project with two applications.
- A homepage displaying a list of available applications.
- A session-based counter that increments on each page refresh and resets after reaching a threshold.
- A deeper understanding of Django’s project structure, routing, templates, and session handling.

This assignment is designed to strengthen your ability to work with Django by reading, reusing, and modifying existing code rather than copying and pasting without comprehension.

# Assignment
##  Set Up Your Django Project
- Create a new Django project named **dj4e** similar to our **first_project** previously.
- Make sure you are following the formatting of placing the django project inside a **django** folder inside the **dj4e** project.
- Confirm that the project runs successfully in your local development environment. (You may need to ensure you modify your ALLOWED_HOSTS)
## Create the Home Application
- Create a new app named **home** inside the **django** folder and register it in `INSTALLED_APPS`.
- Inside **home**, set up a `templates/home/` directory.
- Create a **main.html** template in `home/templates/home/main.html` with the following structure:
```html
<h1>*** (Your Name Here)'s Homepage ***</h1> 
<ul> 
	<li>This will be a list of my apps!</li>
</ul>
```
- Configure the root URL (`/`) to render this template using **TemplateView**.
- Verify that navigating to `/` displays the homepage.
## Create the Hello Application
- Create a new app named **hello** and register it in `INSTALLED_APPS`.
- Define a URL route for **hello** (`/hello/`) and link it to a view function in `views.py`.
- Implement a session-based counter in the view:
    - Retrieve a session variable (e.g., `count`).
    - If it exceeds **4**, reset it to **1**; otherwise, increment it.
    - Display the current counter value in an `HttpResponse`.
- Test that visiting `/hello/` correctly increments and resets the session counter.
## Connect the Hello App to the Homepage
- Add a link in `main.html` to navigate to `/hello/`.
```html
<li>
	<p><a href="/hello">Test the session</a></p>
</li>
```
- Ensure that clicking this link directs users to the session-based page.
## Test and Debug
- Run `python manage.py check` to verify your project has no syntax errors.
- Restart the development server and confirm:
    - `/` loads the homepage.
    - `/hello/` tracks session counts as expected.
    - The counter resets correctly after reaching 4.
## Submission Instructions
Upload the following to Canvas:
1. A screenshot of your homepage (`/`) with the navigation link to **hello**.
2. A screenshot of the **hello** page (`/hello/`), showing the session counter.
3. A screenshot of your browser's developer console displaying the session cookie.
# Final Directory Structure
To ensure everything is as it should be ensure that your project looks like this in final:
```
dj4e/ 
│── django/ # Django project files 
|   ├── dj4e/
│      ├── home/ 
│      ├── hello/
```
